# C64-Kernal-Adapter-Switch-short-board-
This is a Kernal Adapter/Switch for the Commodore C64, ASSY250469 (short board). 
Since the BASIC is stored in the same ROM, some circuit is required to allow a stable access to BASIC, while the Kernal can be selected.
The kernal selection can be configured with jumpers, a switch or even with a micro controller. +5V are provided on the pin header for this purpose.

This development was inspired by Adrian Black's youtube video <a href="https://youtu.be/GPq5xnJRw2w">How-To: C64 Arduino based Restore Key/Four Kernal Switcher/Hard Reset</a>
